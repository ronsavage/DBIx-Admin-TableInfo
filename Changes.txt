Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Admin::TableInfo.

2.00  Thu Apr 20 11:19:00 2006
	- Add primary key info
	- Add foreign key info
	- Rename parameters to new():
		o table_catalog is now catalog
		o table_schema is now schema
		o column_catalog is now catalog
		o column_schema is now schema
	- Add parameters to new() to support Oracle:
		o table
		o type
	- Document parameter values for:
		o MS Access
		o MySQL
		o Oracle
		o PostgreSQL
	- Update docs
	- Rewrite examples/test-table-info.pl to use Data::Dumper
	- Chop examples/test-table-info.cgi because it added nothing useful to the distro

1.03  Thu Oct 27 19:40:00 2005
	- Simplify code in new() to no longer check if caller is an object
		as per the new standard on such matters
	- Regenerate META.yml with Module::Build V 0.2611 to correct a faulty
		META.yml output by V 0.24 which falsely said 'provides: {}',
		which in turn stopped the PAUSE indexer from finding the module file,
		which in turn meant this module might be omitted from the master index:
		ftp://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/modules/01modules.index.html

1.02  Mon Jul 19 14:43:00 2004
	- Change Makefile.PL to coexist with Module::Build
	- Add comments to the POD about having tested against MySQL V 4, MS Access V 2 (sic) and MS Access 2002
	- Add t/pod.t to test all PODs

1.01  Wed Mar  3 10:08:41 2004
	- Add method refresh() to re-create internal data by re-calling DBI's table_info().
		This has to be called after you change the database structure, eg by doing
		'drop table <some table>' or something similar

1.00  Tue Jan 21 12:37:29 2004
	- Original version
